# CLAIMED - The Component Library for AI, Machine Learning, ETL, and Data Science

**TL;DR** [Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhrIzLgY-Cg)
- set of re-usable coarse-grained components (just a bunch of code)
- think of tasks, not functions (e.g., read from a database, transform data, train model, deploy model, store result to cloud object storage)
- write once, runs everywhere: Kubeflow, Apache Airflow, CLI, KNative, Docker, Kubernetes
- orchestrate with anything: shell script, Kubeflow, Airflow, Argo, Tekton
- persistence layer / queue agnostic: Cloud Object Storage, file systems, PVC, Kafka, MQTT
- just use Python - no other skills required (no Kubeflow component YAML, maven, Java)
- 1st class citizen in JupyterLab and the Elyra Pipeline Editor (creating a low code / no code IDE for data science)
- upstream repository to IBM Watson Studio Pipelines contributed components in IBM Cloud Pak for Data
