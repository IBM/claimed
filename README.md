# ▶ Anomaly Detection

All tools used and presented in this course are open source or based  on open source. Therefore it should be possible to run and pass the  assignments outside the IBM Cloud. On Face-2-Face trainings though we've  experienced quite some additional work in configuring and maintaining  such environments. Therefore we highly recommend to use the IBM Cloud -  as it is free, no credit card is needed to use it and you can scale up  to 21 CPU cores and 84 GB of main memory.   Please understand that in the discussion forum we can only support learners on the IBM Cloud – since we know this environment very well and it is the same for all learners.  IBM Cloud is constantly changing and improving. But therefore the UI  and setup procedures are constantly changing as well. For that reason we  are keeping an updated video ready for you on a weekly basis. These are  by purpose hosted outside Coursera since based on their nature we can't  always ensure the high quality standards of Coursera. Sometimes they  are recorded during periods of business travel.
